Jason Lai: A Guide to Working with Me

This is a living document intended to serve as a "user manual" for working with me. It’s inspired by the transparent culture of open-source communities. My goal here is to accelerate our working relationship by being upfront about my communication style, my professional philosophy, my quirks, and my values.

🎯 My Role

As a Legal Builder, my core function is to transform regulatory fog into deployment velocity. In the fast-paced worlds of Web3 and AI, "legal" must move at the speed of product.

I don't view legal as a back-office compliance checkpoint; I view it as a strategic growth lever. I am here to help founders and investment teams navigate gray zones so they can outmaneuver incumbents safely.

🧠 Professional Philosophy

Builder-First: Having transitioned across a Paralegal/Government/Head of Legal to a Fractional GC, I care about your product roadmap just as much as the compliance matrix.

Clarity and Brevity: I strongly believe in "Smart Brevity." If I am handing an investment committee or a founder a 20-page memo, I have failed. I distill complex risk into actionable decision logs, trackers, and go/no-go inputs.

Embrace the Gray: Perfect regulatory clarity does not exist in crypto or any emerging tech areas. My job is to underwrite the risk based on reason and human emotions and behaviors, provide Best/Base/Worst case scenarios, and give you the confidence to ship.

💬 Communication Preferences

Async vs. Sync: The Right Tool for the Job

Async (Deep Work): For legal and regulatory analysis, share your thoughts and questions, along with facts and scenarios. This removes timezone limits and allows for "second thoughts" and creative reflection.

Sync (Firefighter Mode): For quick gut-checks, DM me on Telegram/Signal. This is for sprinting through urgent issues in real-time.

Response Times: I generally reply to messages within 12 hours generally, 4 hours during work hours. If it's a true emergency, call me even if it's in the middle of night.

🤝 How I Handle Conflict and Pushback

I don’t mistake the law for the status quo. I’m here to help build the future, not rap sheet. Still, there is a hard line at actual wrongdoing. I’m not your guy if you want to learn How to Get Away with Murder——stick to Netflix.

With a scout’s curiosity, Bayesian probability lens, and relentless fact-driven legal scrutiny, I welcome pushback——it’s the fastest way to calibrate new facts and whether we’re building something sustainable and unbreakable. 

💡 Fun facts About me:

1. I'm really bad at memorizing names—I even have to finish non-fiction books in a single week, or I have to start them over from the beginning.

2. I love connecting the dots—I find similarities between Frieren (芙莉蓮) and Sheldon, and those little discoveries genuinely entertain me.

3. I'm a quote nerd, which has taught me that most famous quotes weren't actually said by the people we credit them to.
   (e.g., Mark Twain probably didn't say, “If you have to eat a frog, eat it first thing in the morning; if you have to eat two, eat the bigger one first.”)
   It reminds me: attribution is often fluff—the real value is in the idea itself, plus you can rarely prove a negative anyway (thanks, burden of proof).

 
Note: This README is a living document. As I learn, grow, and adapt, this guide will evolve alongside me.
